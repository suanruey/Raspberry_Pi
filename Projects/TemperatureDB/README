The purpose of the temperature grab project is to, get the temperature date from Raspberry Pi Sensehat.

The database used in the Raspberry pi must use the LAMP concept.

The things to be used are, in Linux platform, Apache web server in browser, Maria Database SQL, and Php Admin for front-end data display.

The table parameters are as follows:

No.	Name	  Data      Type	  Length	                Default	                        Attributes	                  Index	    A_I

2	  TempID	Int	      4	                              As Defined: <Your index number>			
3	  Temp	  Float					
4	  Date	  TimeStamp	                                CURRENT_TIMESTAMP	              on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP		
5	  Status	varchar	  20
